# I was tasked with setting up the GUI dropdown menu for loading in the models.
# After setting up dropdown menu, I made sure when a model was selected, a message would indicate which model is selected
# The model that was selected from the dropdown menu would load onto MannequinScene
# Next, I incorporated the joint control and movement to each model
# Currently, each model can be loaded in and their joints can move according to the keyboard
